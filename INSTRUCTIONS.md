### Understanding the Output

The tool creates a new Excel file with several key sheets:

2. **DO TB**: Added sheet containing trial balance data.
3. **DO UCO to UDO**: Added sheet containing UCO to UDO TIER data.

The tool adds the following elements to the reconciled file:

- **Tickmarks**: Special symbols that indicate whether values match or differ.
- **Yellow Highlighting**: Indicates important cells that have been verified.
- **DO Comments**: Column for any automated or manual comments about the reconciliation.

### Interpreting Tickmarks

- **âœ“** (checkmark symbol): Values match correctly.
- **X**: Values do not match, indicating a discrepancy.
- Other special characters may be used to indicate specific matching conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Excel File Access Errors**:
   - Ensure all Excel files are closed before running the tool.
   - If errors persist, restart Excel and try again.

2. **Component Sheet Not Found**:
   - Verify that the component name selected matches the sheet names in your Excel files.
   - Check that component sheets are formatted correctly with "UCO total reported in TIER" and "UDO total reported in TIER" cells.

3. **Missing Financial Data**:
   - Ensure Trial Balance file contains the component total sheet (e.g., "WMD Total").
   - Ensure TIER file contains the "UCO to UDO" sheet.

### Log Files

The application creates detailed log files in the "logs" directory. These logs are helpful for diagnosing issues and are named with the date and time of execution (e.g., "UCOtoUDORecon_Log_2025-05-09_10-40-46.txt").

If you encounter problems, please check these logs for error messages that can help identify the source of the issue.
